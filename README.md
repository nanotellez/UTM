Used Textbook Marketplace (my own version)

Continuing work on a group project from my time at Coding Dojo.

It's a proof of concept of a website application that allows users to post books for sale and look for books they need. 
It includes a "wall"-type messaging system so users can ask questions about and make offers on the books they want. 

Once a book owner decides to sell a book, the book post is marked "sold" and the seller gets the email address of the buyer.
